# Welcome to the World of Data!

Everything on the face of the planet that is either human or created by a human relies on data. Humans receive data through their seneses, internalize the data (by cleaning it up, analyzing, and storing it if necessary), and then react based on the data. Computers do the same thing. They receive some input, process it, then create an output. We churn out xxxxx amounts of data over an xxxxx amount of time. That's taken from this source here.

## Data Science
Data science deals with receiving tons of data. How much? It depends.

Data scientists have to manage a lot of data, making sure to keep consistent records. They also have to clean the data. Cleaning data takes up probably about 70% of the job. What does *dirty* data look like? Well, something like this. Clean data, or *tidy* data looks something like this.

After data is cleaned, it can then be analyzed to see if there are any statistical significances. Data scientists use descriptive statistics to find if the data contains anything noteworthy. Sometimes, data is "useless". There is no such thing as useless data; there is only data that isn't helpful, yet!

Data scientists take their analyzed data and visualize it using a special set of tools (pretty pictures, woooh!).

Their job is to find anomalies in the data and present them.

## Data Journalism
Data journalists play a significant role in the world of reporting. They do a lot of what data scientists do, except with a little bit of a public spin on their job. They have to create a story out of their data, instead of just saying "here are the facts". These data journalists answer a specific question (or set of questions).

They find an interesting lead, and then they go out hunting for the data they need. After finding their dataset, they then follow in a data scientist's path to find some statistical significance in their hard won dataset. Data journalists then visualize their statistical significance, and form a story around it. They find meaningful relations to the data (people, history, locations, etc.). Their job is to make you **feel** what the data says.

# Let's Get Started!

Our first dataset will be the **iris flower dataset**. [You can read up on it here.]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set"). It is a collection of 3 classes of flowers and some of their attributes.
